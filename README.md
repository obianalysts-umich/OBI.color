# OBI.color

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of OBI.color is to put OBI style colors in one place, so we
donâ€™t have to use hex to define colors.

The OBI style colors are based on OBI Style Guide

## Naming convention

Color names are based on this document. All three primary colors are
named as `prim_`.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(OBI.color)

# use individaul colors
scales::show_col(Lilac)
```
